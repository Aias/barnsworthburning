Towns,"We begin with that part of the language which defines a town or community. These patterns can never be ""designed"" or ""built"" in one fell swoop - but patient piecemeal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it.","World Government,Regional Policies,City Policies,Self-Governing Communities,Community Networks,Community and Neighborhood Policies,Local Centers,Housing Clusters,Work Communities,Transportation Networks,Public Land,Common Land,Structures for the Family,Structures for Workgroups,Structures for Community","8.

Buildings,"We now start that part of the language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions. These are the patterns which can be ""designed"" or ""built""—the patterns which define the individual buildings and the space between buildings, where we are dealing for the first time with patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once.","The Site,Building Arrangement,Building Layout,Site Connections,Building Movement,Rooms for a House,Rooms for a Workplace,Outbuildings,Edge Details,Gardens,Minor Rooms,The Shape of Space,Walls and Divisions","95.

Construction,"At this stage, you have a complete design for an individual building. If you have followed the patterns given, you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate to the nearest foot or so. You know the height of rooms, the rough size and position of windows and doors, and you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and the gardens are laid out.

The next, and last part of the language, tells you how to make a buildable building directly from this rough scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail.","Philosophy of Structure,Final Plans,The Main Frame,Openings,Subsidiary Patterns,Indoor Details,Outdoor Details,Things","205.
