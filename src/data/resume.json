As one of only two designer-developer 'slashies', I also had the opportunity not just to design, but to code many of the projects I worked on, often focused on improving design tools and processes.",

His knowledge of data visualization principles and techniques were of constant help, and the various educational design presentations he made to hundreds of our staff (including both designers and non-designers) were some of their favorites. Nick would be a strong asset to any user-centered team."
