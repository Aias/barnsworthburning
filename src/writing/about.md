## about the site

**`barnsworthburning.net`** is a digital [commonplace book](/spaces/commonplace) maintained by [Nick Trombley](http://nicktrombley.design), a web designer & developer living in Boston. The `.net` domain has no special significance aside from the fact that those are my initials.

The organizing concept for this site is simple: *people make things which communicate ideas.* Here I've collected some of those things and ideas, loosely joined, presented usually without additional context or comment. You're free to make of them what you will.

"Barns worth burning" used to be a fairly obscure reference to Haruki Murakami's short story, [Barn Burning](/works/barn-burning). Since the release of Chang-dong Lee's [film adaptation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7282468/), it's slightly less obscure.
