# The Facts

This is the personal website, portfolio, and commonplace book of Nick Trombley.
I am currently based in Tokyo,
and available for hire:
full-time, remote, or freelance work is welcome,
in that preferred order.
<a href="/files/trombley_resume_2019.pdf" target="_blank">Before this</a>, I worked for about six years at <a href="https://www.epic.com" target="_blank">Epic</a>,
a health IT / EMR software company in Verona, Wisconsin.
We did not create <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/home" target="_blank">Fortnite</a>.
My first job involved database administration,
systems monitoring,
report writing,
and answering questions.
My second job involved asking them.
In the time since I have called myself a designer,
I have focused on:
creating and maintaining design systems,
building useful tools that repay the time they're given,
teaching design principles,
and advising development teams
at an enterprise scale.

This site is the product of a passion
