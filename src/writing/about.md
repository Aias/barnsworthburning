# The Facts

This is the personal website,
design / development portfolio,
and [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) of Nick Trombley.

I am currently living in Tokyo,
and available for hire:
full-time, remote, or freelance work is welcome,
in that preferred order.

<a href="/files/trombley_resume_2019.pdf" target="_blank">Before this</a>, I worked for about six years at <a href="https://www.epic.com" target="_blank">Epic</a>,
an EMR / EHR / health IT company in America's Dairyland.
My first job involved database administration,
systems monitoring,
report writing,
and answering questions.
My second job involved asking them.
In the time since I have called myself a designer,
I have focused on:
creating and maintaining design systems,
building helpful, user-friendly tools,
teaching design principles,
and advising development teams
at an enterprise scale.

This site is the product of a passion
for [ideas](/commonplace/spaces/thinking),
for [creation](/commonplace/spaces/creativity),
and for [connection](/commonplace/spaces/love).
