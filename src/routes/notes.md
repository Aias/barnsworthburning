# Special pages

Some ideas for one-off pages that could be implemented as easter eggs.

## (the website as a home)

-   Entrance (doorway): https://startpages.github.io/
-   Exit (through the gift shop): https://notes.at/giftshop
-   Backyard: http://backyard.fragmentscenario.com/
-   Attic
-   Cellar
-   Fridge door / corkboard tasks: https://letorey.co.uk/tasks/ (I like this idea, but I think what I like even _more_ is the idea of having tasks _for the visitor of this site_, i.e. "here are some things you should do to help orient yourself. A kind of travel guide for your own website.)
